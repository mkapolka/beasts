THE TRAVELER'S TRAVAILS
=======================
First Sally
-----------
This new world is made of cruciform lattices of divine beasts.  Each beast has
4 hearts, within which dwell another beast.  By examining the hearts of these
beasts we can discover new ones, and through the hearts of those new beasts we
discover more and more, recursively.

The sum network of all the beasts so linked comprises the whole of this world.
When travelling here you must be so careful where you go.  A beast contained in
teh heart of one may not have his referrer in any of his own hearts.  Through
chains of relations you may some day return to where you started, or you may
never return at all.

Lattice Pattern
---------------
A pattern appears in many regions of this world.  A beast will have four
different neighbors. The neighbor he holds in his first heart will have him in
her second.  The neighbor she keeps in her first heart will, likewise, keep her
in his second.  The third and fourth hearts keep similar relationships.

In this way the relationship between two beasts is reciprocated.

In different regions this reciprocation may take on regional variations. In
some strata the reciprocation happens on the same heart.  That is if Zora is in
Abru's first heart, then Abrus is in Zora's first heart as well.  In some cases
the first and third heart may be used.

The pattern of reciprocity exists, I think, to temper the power & hold the
beasts accountable for the power they have over one another.

Agency
------
The beasts' agency is simple, but powerful.  By reaching their probosca down
throught their hearts and through the veins of the linked beasts that comprise
their immediate & distant neighbors, they can transfer the images of those
beasts into their own or a neighbor's heart.

By snaking a proboscis through the network of neighboring beasts they can transfer the image
 of another beast into another heart.

If my language here is confusing I apologize. It is, after all, a translation from the embodied language of the beasts themselves.
The language you read this in was created to suit a world with different laws than this one. Not that your language hasn't expressed stranger concepts... well anyway

Patterns
========
The beasts of this world arrange themselves into patterns to bring order to the world and facilitate their doings.

Chains
------
Chains form when a series of beasts align themselves along an axis, each connecting to the next through the same heart.

Rills
-----
When all the members of a chain have, in a consistent location, sequential beasts of another order I call it a rill.

Collectives
-----------
The concerted effort of a group of connected beasts can establish an oroder
greater than the sum of the individuals. Each beast is limited to performing
his singular instruction in lock step with his heartbeats, and as such his
ability to effect change is predictable and rudamentary. If one beast's role in
life is to instill his neighbor into another, and the other never changes, the
nthe system will never change. If another beast comes along and periodically
changes the first beast's neighbor, however, there is dynamism.

What to call a group of beasts so intertwined? A community? A collective? A
grand beast?

If it seems excessive to call such simple atoms beasts, remember that in your travels you've been swooned 
by simpler constructions. The goombahs are no more intelligent than the divine beasts but they are endowed with a 
lively personality when considered with the right mindset.

Rill Riders
-----------
Rill Riders travel along the rills, giving access ot hte rillstones for their purposes. many rill riders don't do much at all,
only travel for the sake of travel. Some monitor their rillstone's galls and try to trap their prey in prisons.

Prisons
-------
The nature of the beast's hearts is unidirectional. It is common for a beast to link back to his neighbors, but not required.
AS such some regions of beasts are closed to the outside owrld. Once within tehir network of beasts there is no escape. For those
that experience the beasts as locations, like the demiurge and his guests do, this can become a sort of prison.

The smallest of tehse prisons is a single beast whose hearts all lead to itself. The Narcissistic Beast's links are perpetually reset
to itself by machinery that I cannot find links to, even along the golden rill.

The Golden Rill
---------------
The Golden Rill is a rill whose stones comprise every other beast in the world. Excepting, well, who knows how many beasts could exist beyond
what can be found from the origin. The golden rill is traversed by golden rill riders who, by the demiurge's gall, make themselves discoverable
as they  traverse the golden rillstones.

Sesquelon
---------
First of the great herds I discovered, is a sprawling plain, wrapping in all
directions. Unseen at first, the land is snaked with rills along which the
beasts of the demiurge lurk and snatch up his visitors.

Peppered along the plains are the shell homes of the jumjum snails who
loam along, always going pothy until they cannot find new beasts at which
point they return to their homes and start again.

The pride of Sesquelon was once the great monolith at its center, each side of which led
to the land of Tormlo, but each to a different place within. Now it is some monument to
the Demiurge's ego.

Tormlo
------
Those in the thrall of the demiurge should move with caution in the realm of Tormlo, for the edges
of the catwalks here lead straight into the maw of the narcissistic beast.

Two twins, Tubby and Tooly, hop along the catwalks, and throw themselves into the fangs of the narcissistic 
beast over and over again.

In the center of this region, where all the paths join, is a long ladder to Leordan.

Leordan
-------
Leordan has two parts- a wrapping floor whose borders skitter around and obscure teh space of the region, and a canopy of bounded clumps.
On the carpet the groosky sniders work tirelessly to shift the borders of Leordan.
The poffs in the canopy are regularly isolated, although occasionally the Large Bird will set his feet down, connecting them.
